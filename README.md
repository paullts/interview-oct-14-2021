# How to run this project on your local machine

## Caveat

- I will add `.env` to `.gitignore` file, but this project is just for demo purpose, and the API is a public API,
  so I decide to push to github include `.env` file.

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
3. Open your browser with url: `http://localhost:3000`

## TODO

- [x] Config Router. <br />
- [x] Add `country`, `date_from, `date_to` to router. <br />
- [ ] Setup testing and write test case for redux actions and reducers.
