# How to run this project on your local machine

## Caveat

- I will add `.env` to `.gitignore` file, but this project is just for demo purpose, and the API is a public API,
  so I decide to push to github include `.env` file.

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
3. Open your browser with url: `http://localhost:3000`

## Third party library that I use in this project

1. bootstrap
2. react-datepicker
3. react-redux
4. react-router-dom
5. redux-thunk
